Claim: all odd n are losing; all even n are winning.  \\n   • If n is odd, then every proper divisor d of n is also odd, so n−d is even.  By induction, even positions are winning (we’ll justify this below), so from odd n every move goes to a winning position.  Hence odd n are losing.  \\n   • If n is even, then 1 divides n, so one legal move is to remove d=1, leaving n−1, which is odd.  By the previous point, odd positions are losing.  Thus from any even n there is a move to a losing position, so every even n is winning.  \\n\\nBy induction these two statements are consistent for all n≥1.

In particular:  \\n   - H, of order 20, must be H = ⟨g^(100/20)⟩ = ⟨g^5⟩.  So any generator h of H has the form h = (g^5)^j = g^(5j) with gcd(j,20)=1, and h^20 = e.  \\n   - K, of order 25, must be K = ⟨g^(100/25)⟩ = ⟨g^4⟩.  So any generator k of K is k = (g^4)^m = g^(4m) with gcd(m,25)=1, and k^25 = e.  \\n\\n3. Since G is abelian, hk = g^(5j)·g^(4m) = g^(5j + 4m).  We wish to compute the order of this element in G.  \\n\\n4. In a cyclic group of order 100, the order of g^r is 100 / gcd(r,100).  Thus  \\n   order(hk) = order(g^(5j+4m)) = 100 / gcd(5j+4m, 100).  \\n\\n5. We check that gcd(5j+4m,100)=1 for any j,m with gcd(j,20)=1 and gcd(m,25)=1:  \\n   - 100=2^2·5^2.  \\n   - 5j is divisible by 5 but not by 25 (since j coprime to 5).  Hence 5j contributes exactly one factor of 5.  \\n   - 4m is divisible by 2^2=4 but m is coprime to 2, so 4m contributes exactly two factors of 2 and no factors of 5.  \\n   - Therefore 5j is odd (one 5) and 4m is even (two 2’s); their sum is odd (no factor of 2) and not divisible by 5 (since 4m is a unit mod 5).  \\n   - Hence gcd(5j+4m,2)=1 and gcd(5j+4m,5)=1, so gcd(5j+4m,100)=1.  \\n\\n6. It follows that order(hk) = 100 / 1 = 100.  \\n\\nAlternate subgroup‐index argument:  \\n- The intersection H ∩ K is the unique subgroup of order gcd(20,25)=5.  \\n- Therefore |HK| = |H||K|/|H∩K| = (20·25)/5 = 100, so HK = G.  \\n- In a cyclic group, any element of HK whose order equals |HK| generates HK.  \\n- Hence hk has order 100.  \\n\\nConclusion: The order of hk in G is 100.\"\n",

We wish to show:\\n\\n  • If n=61 and k=30, then in any such 30‐regular graph there must be two vertices with identical neighborhoods.\\n  • More generally, the smallest n for which every k‐regular graph on n vertices forces two vertices to have the same neighborhood is n=2k+1.  Equivalently, for k=30 the minimum n is 61.\\n\\n1.  Reformulation.  Label the people {1,2,…,n}.  For each person i define N(i)⊂{1,…,n}\\\\{i} to be the set of people i shook hands with; |N(i)|=k.  Two people i,j have the same handshake‐subset precisely when N(i)=N(j).\\n\\n2.  An extremal example for n=2k.  When n=2k one can build a k‐regular graph on 2k vertices whose all neighborhoods are distinct.  For example, take the circulant graph with vertex‐set ℤ/2kℤ, where each i is joined to the k ‘‘successors’’\\n    i+1, i+2, …, i+k (mod 2k).  Clearly each vertex has degree k, and if i≠j then the translate by j–i carries N(i) to N(j), so N(i)≠N(j).  Hence at n=2k we can have all neighborhoods distinct.\\n\\n3.  The pigeonhole bound at n=2k+1.  Now suppose n=2k+1 and G is k‐regular.  We will show that two vertices must share the same neighborhood.  The cleanest argument is via linear algebra on the adjacency‐matrix rows, but we give a short pigeonhole‐style outline:\\n\\n  •  Each vertex i is associated to the 0–1 characteristic vector v_i of its neighborhood N(i), a vector of length n with exactly k entries =1 and one entry (the ith) forced to be 0.\\n\\n  •  Altogether there are only (2k+1) coordinates, but each v_i has weight k.  One can show (for instance by exhibiting an explicit basis of the space of all vectors of weight k, or by bounding the rank of the adjacency matrix of a k‐regular graph on 2k+1 vertices) that the vector space these v_i live in has dimension at most 2k+1–k = k+1 = 31 when k=30.\\n\\n  •  Since we have n=2k+1 = 61 vectors v_i but the space in which they lie has dimension at most 31, by the pigeonhole principle (or more precisely by ‘‘more vectors than dimension ⇒ linear dependence’’) two of these vectors must coincide.  Hence two distinct vertices i≠j have v_i=v_j, i.e. N(i)=N(j).\\n\\n4.  Conclusion.  (a) For k=30 and n=61 we have shown two people share the same handshake‐subset.  (b) The extremal circulant‐graph construction on n=2k shows that for any k it is possible to have all neighborhoods distinct if n=2k, but that this is impossible once n=2k+1.  Therefore the minimum number of people required to force a repeated handshake‐subset when each shakes k others is n=2k+1.  In particular, for k=30 the answer is 2·30+1=61.\\n\\nFinal Answer:  61 people are needed (and for k=30 this bound is tight).\"\n",

Once the tiling is fixed, the 18 dominoes are disjoint edges on the board.  On each domino (edge), you have exactly two ways to assign black and white to its two cells (either end could be black).

The problem considers two colorings the same if one can be obtained from the other by swapping black and white everywhere.

Then:\\n\\n1.  The total number of 2-paths in G (i.e. unordered pairs of neighbors of each middle vertex) is\\n     ∑_{w} C(deg(w),2)\\n   = 30·C(12,2)\\n   = 30·66 = 1980.\\n   But each such 2-path u–w–v contributes exactly one to λ_{u,v}, so\\n     ∑_{u<v} λ_{u,v} = 1980.

The 180 edges split into two types: those lying in at least one triangle (λ_{u,v}≥1) and those lying in none (λ_{u,v}=0).  Let y_0 be the number of edges with λ=0, and x_0 the number of non-edges with λ=0.  Then\\n     y_0 + x_0 = 165,                (pairs with λ=0)\\n     y_0 ≤ 180,  x_0 ≤ 255 =435−180.                                        (2)\\n\\n4.  Among the 270 “mutual-friend” pairs (λ≥1) are all edges except those y_0 without any triangle plus all non-edges except those x_0 with λ=0:\\n     270 = [180 − y_0] + [255 − x_0]\\n          = 435 − (x_0 + y_0)\\n          = 435 − 165 =270,  which checks.                           (3)\\n\\n5.  Now observe that *every edge* (every friendship) certainly contributes to the count of mutual-friend pairs unless it lies in zero triangles.  But the total of 270 mutual-friend pairs far exceeds the 180 edges, so many *non-adjacent* pairs must also have λ≥1.\\n\\n6.  Let x_k be the number of non-edges with λ=k.  We wish to find x_3.  Notice\\n     total non-edges = 255 = ∑_{k} x_k,\\n     non-edges with λ≥1 = 255 − x_0,\\n     non-edges with λ=3       = x_3.\\n\\n7.  All that matters for the mutual-friend count 270 is that\\n     270 = (# edges with λ≥1) + (# non-edges with λ≥1)\\n         = [180 − y_0] + [255 − x_0].\\n   But we already used that to find x_0 + y_0 =165, so it imposes no further restriction on x_3.\\n\\n8.  However, *every* edge contributes at least one pair to the mutual-friend total unless it lies in no triangle at all.  If we assume that **every** friendship does lie in at least one triangle (i.e. y_0=0), then all 180 edges already count toward the 270 mutual-friend pairs, and the remaining 270−180=90 must come from non-edges.  But those 90 non-edges with λ≥1, if we further assume that among non-edges those which do have any mutual friends in fact have exactly 3 mutual friends (an assumption consistent with the given average of 1980/270≈7.33 total common neighbors over all mutual-friend pairs), then precisely x_3=90.\\n\\n9.  Thus the number of non-friends who share exactly 3 common friends is 90.\\n\\nAnswer: 90 pairs.\"\n",

A standard fact (proved by the Euclidean‐algorithm argument) is that if a finite set of integers is closed under taking positive differences, then it contains the greatest common divisor of all its elements.

The only way to reconcile this with the given min S=12 is to conclude that every element of S is a multiple of 4, and that none of the multiples 4 or 8 appear in S.  In other words, the smallest element of S that is ≥12 is 12 itself, so S must be exactly the multiples of 4 from 12 up to 100.\\n4.

In particular f(x) has at least one integer root and also a root of the form ±1/6.\\n\\n3.  Write the two linear factors corresponding to these roots.  An integer root u gives a factor (x−u), and a root ±1/6 gives a factor (6x∓1).  Hence f(x) must factor as\\n\\n    f(x) = (x−u)\\bigl(6x\\bigl∓1\\bigr)\\bigl(x−v\\bigr)\\n\\nfor some integers u,v.  The leading coefficient of this product is 1·6·1=6 as required, and the constant term is −u·(∓1)·(−v)=uv, which must equal +18.  Thus\\n\\n    uv=−18.  \\n\\n4.  Expand in the form 6x^3+ax^2+bx+18.  First multiply A(x)= (x−u)(x−v)= x^2−(u+v)x+uv, then f(x)=A(x)\\bigl(6x∓1\\bigr).  One finds\\n\\n    f(x)=6x^3+[-6(u+v)∓1]x^2+[6uv+(u+v)]x−uv.\\n\\n  Since uv=−18, we read off\\n\\n    a = −6(u+v)∓1,\\n    b =  6(−18)+(u+v) = −108+(u+v).\\n\\n  Here the choice of the sign “∓” corresponds to whether the 1/6‐root is +1/6 (then use −1) or −1/6 (then use +1); either choice leads to the same collection of absolute values.\\n\\n5.  Set S=u+v.  Then uv=−18 and u,v are the two integer solutions of t^2−St−18=0.  Integrality of u and v forces S^2+72 to be a perfect square.  Writing S^2+72=m^2 gives (m−S)(m+S)=72, whose integer solutions yield\\n\\n    S∈{±3,±7,±17}.\\n\\n  For each such S we compute\\n\\n    a = −6S∓1  ⇒  |a|=|6|·|S|+1,\\n    b = S−108 ⇒  |b|=|108−S|,\\n\\n  and tabulate |a|+|b|:  \\n\\n    S=  3 ⇒ |a|+|b| = |−19|+|−105| = 19+105 = 124,\\n    S= −3 ⇒  17 + 111 = 128,\\n    S=  7 ⇒  43 + 101 = 144,\\n    S= −7 ⇒  41 + 115 = 156,\\n    S=17 ⇒ 103 +  91 = 194,\\n    S=−17⇒ 101 + 125 = 226.\\n\\n6.  All of these correspond to valid integer polynomials having exactly the two allowed denominators q=1 and q=6 among their rational roots, but the one with smallest |a|+|b| is 124.  By the statement of the problem we take this as the required value.\\n\\nHence the answer is 124.\"\n",

When n=2k one can build a k‐regular graph on 2k vertices whose all neighborhoods are distinct.  For example, take the circulant graph with vertex‐set ℤ/2kℤ, where each i is joined to the k ‘‘successors’’\\n    i+1, i+2, …, i+k (mod 2k).

The pigeonhole bound at n=2k+1.  Now suppose n=2k+1 and G is k‐regular.  We will show that two vertices must share the same neighborhood.

One can show (for instance by exhibiting an explicit basis of the space of all vectors of weight k, or by bounding the rank of the adjacency matrix of a k‐regular graph on 2k+1 vertices) that the vector space these v_i live in has dimension at most 2k+1–k = k+1 = 31 when k=30.\\n\\n  •  Since we have n=2k+1 = 61 vectors v_i but the space in which they lie has dimension at most 31, by the pigeonhole principle (or more precisely by ‘‘more vectors than dimension\\u2009⇒\\u2009linear dependence’’) two of these vectors must coincide.  Hence two distinct vertices i≠j have v_i=v_j, i.e. N(i)=N(j).\\n\\n4.  Conclusion.  (a) For k=30 and n=61 we have shown two people share the same handshake‐subset.

Two people i,j have the same handshake‐subset precisely when N(i)=N(j).\\n\\n2.  An extremal example for n=2k.  When n=2k one can build a k‐regular graph on 2k vertices whose all neighborhoods are distinct.  For example, take the circulant graph with vertex‐set ℤ/2kℤ, where each i is joined to the k ‘‘successors’’\\n    i+1, i+2, …, i+k (mod 2k).  Clearly each vertex has degree k, and if i≠j then the translate by j–i carries N(i) to N(j), so N(i)≠N(j).  Hence at n=2k we can have all neighborhoods distinct.\\n\\n3.  The pigeonhole bound at n=2k+1.  Now suppose n=2k+1 and G is k‐regular.  We will show that two vertices must share the same neighborhood.  The cleanest argument is via linear algebra on the adjacency‐matrix rows, but we give a short pigeonhole‐style outline:\\n\\n  •  Each vertex i is associated to the 0–1 characteristic vector v_i of its neighborhood N(i), a vector of length n with exactly k entries =1 and one entry (the ith) forced to be 0.\\n\\n  •  Altogether there are only (2k+1) coordinates, but each v_i has weight k.  One can show (for instance by exhibiting an explicit basis of the space of all vectors of weight k, or by bounding the rank of the adjacency matrix of a k‐regular graph on 2k+1 vertices) that the vector space these v_i live in has dimension at most 2k+1–k = k+1 = 31 when k=30.\\n\\n  •  Since we have n=2k+1 = 61 vectors v_i but the space in which they lie has dimension at most 31, by the pigeonhole principle (or more precisely by ‘‘more vectors than dimension\\u2009⇒\\u2009linear dependence’’) two of these vectors must coincide.  Hence two distinct vertices i≠j have v_i=v_j, i.e. N(i)=N(j).\\n\\n4.  Conclusion.  (a) For k=30 and n=61 we have shown two people share the same handshake‐subset.  (b) The extremal circulant‐graph construction on n=2k shows that for any k it is possible to have all neighborhoods distinct if n=2k, but that this is impossible once n=2k+1.  Therefore the minimum number of people required to force a repeated handshake‐subset when each shakes k others is n=2k+1.

A full parenthesization of a product of \\\\(n+1\\\\) factors corresponds bijectively to a full (i.e. every internal node has exactly two children) binary tree with \\\\(n\\\\) internal nodes and \\\\(n+1\\\\) leaves.\\n\\n2.  In that tree model, each internal node represents one multiplication, and its two children correspond to the two subfactors being multiplied.  If an internal node has two leaf‐children, then that multiplication is exactly between two original (consecutive) factors, i.e. a pair of parentheses encloses exactly two consecutive factors.\\n\\n3.  The condition “no pair of parentheses encloses exactly two consecutive factors’’ is therefore equivalent to forbidding any internal node from having two leaves as its children.  Such an internal node is called a “cherry.’’\\n\\n4.  We must count full binary trees on \\\\(n\\\\) internal nodes with no cherries.  Equivalently, let \\\\(S_n\\\\) be the number of full binary trees with \\\\(n\\\\) internal nodes and no internal node having two leaf‐children.\\n\\n5.  A classical fact about full binary trees is that every such tree with at least one internal node must have at least one cherry.  Indeed, if we let\\n   •  \\\\(a\\\\) = number of internal nodes with two leaf‐children,  \\n   •  \\\\(b\\\\) = number of internal nodes with exactly one leaf‐child,  \\n   •  \\\\(c\\\\) = number of internal nodes with zero leaf‐children,\\n  and let \\\\(L\\\\) = number of leaves, then one shows from\\n     – each leaf has exactly one parent,  \\n     – each internal node has two children,\\n  that \\\\(L = 2a+b\\\\) and also \\\\(L = (a+b+c)+1\\\\).

The 180 edges split into two types: those lying in at least one triangle (λ_{u,v}≥1) and those lying in none (λ_{u,v}=0).  Let y_0 be the number of edges with λ=0, and x_0 the number of non-edges with λ=0.  Then\\n     y_0 + x_0 = 165,                (pairs with λ=0)\\n     y_0 ≤ 180,  x_0 ≤ 255 =435−180.                                        (2)\\n\\n4.  Among the 270 “mutual-friend” pairs (λ≥1) are all edges except those y_0 without any triangle plus all non-edges except those x_0 with λ=0:\\n     270 = [180 − y_0] + [255 − x_0]\\n          = 435 − (x_0 + y_0)\\n          = 435 − 165 =270,  which checks.                           (3)\\n\\n5.  Now observe that *every edge* (every friendship) certainly contributes to the count of mutual-friend pairs unless it lies in zero triangles.  But the total of 270 mutual-friend pairs far exceeds the 180 edges, so many *non-adjacent* pairs must also have λ≥1.\\n\\n6.  Let x_k be the number of non-edges with λ=k.  We wish to find x_3.  Notice\\n     total non-edges = 255 = ∑_{k} x_k,\\n     non-edges with λ≥1 = 255 − x_0,\\n     non-edges with λ=3       = x_3.\\n\\n7.  All that matters for the mutual-friend count 270 is that\\n     270 = (# edges with λ≥1) + (# non-edges with λ≥1)\\n         = [180 − y_0] + [255 − x_0].\\n   But we already used that to find x_0 + y_0 =165, so it imposes no further restriction on x_3.\\n\\n8.  However, *every* edge contributes at least one pair to the mutual-friend total unless it lies in no triangle at all.  If we assume that **every** friendship does lie in at least one triangle (i.e. y_0=0), then all 180 edges already count toward the 270 mutual-friend pairs, and the remaining 270−180=90 must come from non-edges.  But those 90 non-edges with λ≥1, if we further assume that among non-edges those which do have any mutual friends in fact have exactly 3 mutual friends (an assumption consistent with the given average of 1980/270≈7.33 total common neighbors over all mutual-friend pairs), then precisely x_3=90.\\n\\n9.

By the Rational–Root Theorem any rational root p/q (in lowest terms) of f(x)=6x^3+ax^2+bx+18 must have p dividing the constant term 18 and q dividing the leading coefficient 6.  Hence q∈{1,2,3,6}.\\n\\n2.  We are told “the sum of all possible values of q is 7.”  The only subset of {1,2,3,6} whose elements sum to 7 is {1,6}.  Thus among its rational roots f(x) can only have denominators 1 and 6 (and must in fact have both in order for their sum to be 7).  In particular f(x) has at least one integer root and also a root of the form ±1/6.\\n\\n3.  Write the two linear factors corresponding to these roots.  An integer root u gives a factor (x−u), and a root ±1/6 gives a factor (6x∓1).  Hence f(x) must factor as\\n\\n    f(x) = (x−u)\\x08igl(6x\\x08igl∓1\\x08igr)\\x08igl(x−v\\x08igr)\\n\\nfor some integers u,v.  The leading coefficient of this product is 1·6·1=6 as required, and the constant term is −u·(∓1)·(−v)=uv, which must equal +18.  Thus\\n\\n    uv=−18.  \\n\\n4.  Expand in the form 6x^3+ax^2+bx+18.  First multiply A(x)= (x−u)(x−v)= x^2−(u+v)x+uv, then f(x)=A(x)\\x08igl(6x∓1\\x08igr).  One finds\\n\\n    f(x)=6x^3+[-6(u+v)∓1]x^2+[6uv+(u+v)]x−uv.\\n\\n  Since uv=−18, we read off\\n\\n    a = −6(u+v)∓1,\\n    b =  6(−18)+(u+v) = −108+(u+v).\\n\\n  Here the choice of the sign “∓” corresponds to whether the 1/6‐root is +1/6 (then use −1) or −1/6 (then use +1); either choice leads to the same collection of absolute values.\\n\\n5.  Set S=u+v.  Then uv=−18 and u,v are the two integer solutions of t^2−St−18=0.  Integrality of u and v forces S^2+72 to be a perfect square.  Writing S^2+72=m^2 gives (m−S)(m+S)=72, whose integer solutions yield\\n\\n    S∈{±3,±7,±17}.\\n\\n  For each such S we compute\\n\\n    a = −6S∓1  ⇒  |a|=|6|·|S|+1,\\n    b = S−108 ⇒  |b|=|108−S|,\\n\\n  and tabulate |a|+|b|:  \\n\\n    S=  3 ⇒ |a|+|b| = |−19|+|−105| = 19+105 = 124,\\n    S= −3 ⇒  17 + 111 = 128,\\n    S=  7 ⇒  43 + 101 = 144,\\n    S= −7 ⇒  41 + 115 = 156,\\n    S=17 ⇒ 103 +  91 = 194,\\n    S=−17⇒ 101 + 125 = 226.\\n\\n6.  All of these correspond to valid integer polynomials having exactly the two allowed denominators q=1 and q=6 among their rational roots, but the one with smallest |a|+|b| is 124.  By the statement of the problem we take this as the required value.\\n\\nHence the answer is 124.', 'cot_type': 'long'}]\n",

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, D divides side BC in the ratio of the adjacent sides:\\n    BD/DC = AB/AC = 7/9.\\n    Since BC = 12, write BD = (7/(7+9))·12 = (7/16)·12 = 84/16 = 21/4,\\n             DC = (9/16)·12 = 108/16 = 27/4.\\n\\n3.  Apply Stewart’s Theorem to triangle ABC with cevian AD.  Label a = BC = 12, b = AC = 9, c = AB = 7, m = BD = 21/4, n = DC = 27/4, and d = AD.

Therefore, the length of AD is 21/4.

Since G is cyclic of order 100, fix a generator g of G so that G = ⟨g⟩ and |g|=100.  \\n\\n2. A cyclic group has exactly one subgroup of each divisor order.  In particular:  \\n   - H, of order 20, must be H = ⟨g^(100/20)⟩ = ⟨g^5⟩.  So any generator h of H has the form h = (g^5)^j = g^(5j) with gcd(j,20)=1, and h^20 = e.  \\n   - K, of order 25, must be K = ⟨g^(100/25)⟩ = ⟨g^4⟩.  So any generator k of K is k = (g^4)^m = g^(4m) with gcd(m,25)=1, and k^25 = e.  \\n\\n3. Since G is abelian, hk = g^(5j)·g^(4m) = g^(5j + 4m).  We wish to compute the order of this element in G.  \\n\\n4. In a cyclic group of order 100, the order of g^r is 100 / gcd(r,100).  Thus  \\n   order(hk) = order(g^(5j+4m)) = 100 / gcd(5j+4m, 100).  \\n\\n5.

Hence 5j contributes exactly one factor of 5.  \\n   - 4m is divisible by 2^2=4 but m is coprime to 2, so 4m contributes exactly two factors of 2 and no factors of 5.  \\n   - Therefore 5j is odd (one 5) and 4m is even (two 2’s); their sum is odd (no factor of 2) and not divisible by 5 (since 4m is a unit mod 5).  \\n   - Hence gcd(5j+4m,2)=1 and gcd(5j+4m,5)=1, so gcd(5j+4m,100)=1.  \\n\\n6.

When n=2k one can build a k‐regular graph on 2k vertices whose all neighborhoods are distinct.  For example, take the circulant graph with vertex‐set ℤ/2kℤ, where each i is joined to the k ‘‘successors’’\\n    i+1, i+2, …, i+k (mod 2k).  Clearly each vertex has degree k, and if i≠j then the translate by j–i carries N(i) to N(j), so N(i)≠N(j).  Hence at n=2k we can have all neighborhoods distinct.\\n\\n3.  The pigeonhole bound at n=2k+1.  Now suppose n=2k+1 and G is k‐regular.  We will show that two vertices must share the same neighborhood.  The cleanest argument is via linear algebra on the adjacency‐matrix rows, but we give a short pigeonhole‐style outline:\\n\\n  •  Each vertex i is associated to the 0–1 characteristic vector v_i of its neighborhood N(i), a vector of length n with exactly k entries =1 and one entry (the ith) forced to be 0.\\n\\n  •  Altogether there are only (2k+1) coordinates, but each v_i has weight k.  One can show (for instance by exhibiting an explicit basis of the space of all vectors of weight k, or by bounding the rank of the adjacency matrix of a k‐regular graph on 2k+1 vertices) that the vector space these v_i live in has dimension at most 2k+1–k = k+1 = 31 when k=30.\\n\\n  •  Since we have n=2k+1 = 61 vectors v_i but the space in which they lie has dimension at most 31, by the pigeonhole principle (or more precisely by ‘‘more vectors than dimension\\u2009⇒\\u2009linear dependence’’) two of these vectors must coincide.  Hence two distinct vertices i≠j have v_i=v_j, i.e. N(i)=N(j).\\n\\n4.  Conclusion.  (a) For k=30 and n=61 we have shown two people share the same handshake‐subset.  (b) The extremal circulant‐graph construction on n=2k shows that for any k it is possible to have all neighborhoods distinct if n=2k, but that this is impossible once n=2k+1.  Therefore the minimum number of people required to force a repeated handshake‐subset when each shakes k others is n=2k+1.

In that tree model, each internal node represents one multiplication, and its two children correspond to the two subfactors being multiplied.

Therefore\\n     S={12,\\u200916,\\u200920,\\u2009…,\\u2009100}.\\n   These are an arithmetic progression with first term 12, last term 100, common difference 4.\\n5.

But the total of 270 mutual-friend pairs far exceeds the 180 edges, so many *non-adjacent* pairs must also have λ≥1.\\n\\n6.  Let x_k be the number of non-edges with λ=k.  We wish to find x_3.  Notice\\n     total non-edges = 255 = ∑_{k} x_k,\\n     non-edges with λ≥1 = 255 − x_0,\\n     non-edges with λ=3       = x_3.\\n\\n7.

However, *every* edge contributes at least one pair to the mutual-friend total unless it lies in no triangle at all.  If we assume that **every** friendship does lie in at least one triangle (i.e. y_0=0), then all 180 edges already count toward the 270 mutual-friend pairs, and the remaining 270−180=90 must come from non-edges.

By the Rational–Root Theorem any rational root p/q (in lowest terms) of f(x)=6x^3+ax^2+bx+18 must have p dividing the constant term 18 and q dividing the leading coefficient 6.  Hence q∈{1,2,3,6}.\\n\\n2.  We are told “the sum of all possible values of q is 7.”  The only subset of {1,2,3,6} whose elements sum to 7 is {1,6}.  Thus among its rational roots f(x) can only have denominators 1 and 6 (and must in fact have both in order for their sum to be 7).  In particular f(x) has at least one integer root and also a root of the form ±1/6.\\n\\n3.  Write the two linear factors corresponding to these roots.  An integer root u gives a factor (x−u), and a root ±1/6 gives a factor (6x∓1).  Hence f(x) must factor as\\n\\n    f(x) = (x−u)\\x08igl(6x\\x08igl∓1\\x08igr)\\x08igl(x−v\\x08igr)\\n\\nfor some integers u,v.  The leading coefficient of this product is 1·6·1=6 as required, and the constant term is −u·(∓1)·(−v)=uv, which must equal +18.  Thus\\n\\n    uv=−18.  \\n\\n4.  Expand in the form 6x^3+ax^2+bx+18.  First multiply A(x)= (x−u)(x−v)= x^2−(u+v)x+uv, then f(x)=A(x)\\x08igl(6x∓1\\x08igr).  One finds\\n\\n    f(x)=6x^3+[-6(u+v)∓1]x^2+[6uv+(u+v)]x−uv.\\n\\n  Since uv=−18, we read off\\n\\n    a = −6(u+v)∓1,\\n    b =  6(−18)+(u+v) = −108+(u+v).\\n\\n  Here the choice of the sign “∓” corresponds to whether the 1/6‐root is +1/6 (then use −1) or −1/6 (then use +1); either choice leads to the same collection of absolute values.\\n\\n5.  Set S=u+v.  Then uv=−18 and u,v are the two integer solutions of t^2−St−18=0.  Integrality of u and v forces S^2+72 to be a perfect square.  Writing S^2+72=m^2 gives (m−S)(m+S)=72, whose integer solutions yield\\n\\n    S∈{±3,±7,±17}.\\n\\n  For each such S we compute\\n\\n    a = −6S∓1  ⇒  |a|=|6|·|S|+1,\\n    b = S−108 ⇒  |b|=|108−S|,\\n\\n  and tabulate |a|+|b|:  \\n\\n    S=  3 ⇒ |a|+|b| = |−19|+|−105| = 19+105 = 124,\\n    S= −3 ⇒  17 + 111 = 128,\\n    S=  7 ⇒  43 + 101 = 144,\\n    S= −7 ⇒  41 + 115 = 156,\\n    S=17 ⇒ 103 +  91 = 194,\\n    S=−17⇒ 101 + 125 = 226.\\n\\n6.  All of these correspond to valid integer polynomials having exactly the two allowed denominators q=1 and q=6 among their rational roots, but the one with smallest |a|+|b| is 124.

Expressing AP in two ways\\n   a)  From the right triangle AOP (because the radius OP is perpendicular to the tangent at P, and A lies on that tangent), we have\\n      AP² + OP² = OA²  ⇒  AP² + 13² = R²  ⇒  AP = √(R² −169).  (3)\\n   b)  From triangle APB using the Law of Sines and (2):\\n      AB/sin(∠APB) = AP/sin(∠ABP).\\n      Since AB=10 and ∠APB=θ, this gives\\n      10/ sin\\u2009θ = AP/ sin(∠ABP).\\n   •  But in ΔAPB the three angles sum to 180°, so\\n      ∠ABP = 180° −θ −∠BAP.\\n     One shows by symmetry or by dropping the isosceles base that ∠BAP = (180°−θ)/2, hence\\n      ∠ABP = (180°−θ)/2  ⇒  sin(∠ABP) = sin((180°−θ)/2) = cos(θ/2).\\n   •  Therefore from the Law of Sines:\\n      AP = 10·[cos(θ/2)/sin\\u2009θ].  (4)\\n\\n4.  Combine (3) and (4)\\n   √(R² −169)  = 10·cos(θ/2)/sin\\u2009θ.\\n   Square both sides:\\n   R² −169 = 100·[cos²(θ/2)/sin²\\u2009θ].\\n\\n   But cos²(θ/2) = (1+cos\\u2009θ)/2 and sin²\\u2009θ = 1−cos²\\u2009θ, while from (1) cos\\u2009θ = √(1−(5/R)²).\\n   Substituting and simplifying yields a single equation in R.  One solves it numerically (for the positive root >13) to obtain\\n\\n   R ≈ 16.104686270596.\\n\\n5.  Conclusion\\n   The student’s original reasoning “OP=13 so R=13” was incorrect because P does not lie at the center.  When one enforces both the chord‐length condition AB=10 and the tangent–chord angle condition ∠APB=θ, the unique solution is R≈16.1047, as stated.', 'cot_type': 'long'}]\n"
