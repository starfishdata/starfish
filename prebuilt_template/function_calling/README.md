# Function Calling Dataset Generation üîß

This template replicates the methodology from the **APIGen paper** to generate high-quality synthetic datasets for training function-calling AI models. 

## What This Does

Generate customized API contract data for function calls - perfect for training models to understand when and how to call specific functions to improve specific tool agentic usage.


## Sample Run

Check out [`sample_run.ipynb`](./sample_run.ipynb) for a complete example you can run right away.

## Source Implementation
