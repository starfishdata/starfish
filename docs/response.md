# Query Response

**Query:** run the template   starfish/generate_city_info 

**Response:**

It seems there was an error due to validation issues with the input data. The `region_code` is missing, and `city_name` should be a valid list. Could you provide the necessary inputs, including the `region_code` and ensure `city_name` is in a list format?

# Query Response

**Query:** yes

**Response:**

It seems the output isn't relevant to the city information for Paris. There might be an issue with the template. Can I assist you with something else?

---

# Query Response

**Query:** return the output

**Response:**

Here is the output of the template execution, but it seems unrelated to Paris:

```plaintext
{
  "answer": "San Francisco_1"
}
{
  "answer": "New York_5"
}
{
  "answer": "Los Angeles_1"
}
```

It seems there is a misalignment with the expected input/output for this template. Would you like me to attempt another task or check the template for issues?
