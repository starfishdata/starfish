    "topic": "Combinatorics, Integer Solutions",

    "reasoning": "The problem asks for the number of integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 30$ with $x_i \ge 0$ subject to additional constraints.
Condition 1 states $x_1 + x_2 = 15$. Since the total number of candies is 30, this implies $x_3 + x_4 = 30 - (x_1 + x_2) = 30 - 15 = 15$. The problem can be solved by finding the number of valid pairs $(x_1, x_2)$ and the number of valid pairs $(x_3, x_4)$ independently and multiplying the results.

Part 1: Find the number of integer solutions for $(x_1, x_2)$ such that $x_1 + x_2 = 15$, $x_1 \ge 0$, $x_2 \ge 0$, $x_1 \ge 5$, and $x_2 \le 8$.
From $x_1 + x_2 = 15$, we have $x_1 = 15 - x_2$.
The constraint $x_1 \ge 5$ becomes $15 - x_2 \ge 5$, which simplifies to $x_2 \le 10$.
The constraint $x_2 \le 8$ is given.
Combining $x_2 \le 10$ and $x_2 \le 8$, we get $x_2 \le 8$.
Also, $x_1 \ge 0$ means $15 - x_2 \ge 0$, so $x_2 \le 15$. This is satisfied by $x_2 \le 8$.
And $x_2 \ge 0$.
So we need integer solutions to $x_1 + x_2 = 15$ with $0 \le x_2 \le 8$.
The possible values for $x_2$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.
For each value of $x_2$, $x_1 = 15 - x_2$ is uniquely determined. Let's check if the $x_1$ constraint ($x_1 \ge 5$) is met.
If $x_2=8$, $x_1=7$. $7 \ge 5$ (satisfied).
If $x_2=0$, $x_1=15$. $15 \ge 5$ (satisfied).
For $0 \le x_2 \le 8$, $x_1 = 15 - x_2$ will range from $15 - 8 = 7$ to $15 - 0 = 15$. All these values are $\ge 7$, hence $\ge 5$.
So, the possible integer values for $x_2$ are $0, 1, \ldots, 8$. The number of such values is $8 - 0 + 1 = 9$.
There are 9 distinct pairs $(x_1, x_2)$ satisfying the conditions.

Part 2: Find the number of integer solutions for $(x_3, x_4)$ such that $x_3 + x_4 = 15$, $x_3 \ge 0$, $x_4 \ge 0$, $x_3$ is even, and $x_3 \ge 2$.
$x_3$ must be an even integer and $x_3 \ge 2$.
Also, since $x_4 \ge 0$ and $x_3 + x_4 = 15$, we must have $x_3 \le 15$.
So, $x_3$ must be an even integer in the range $[2, 15]$.
The possible values for $x_3$ are $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14$.
There are 7 such integer values for $x_3$.
For each value of $x_3$, $x_4 = 15 - x_3$ is uniquely determined. Let's check if the $x_4$ constraint ($x_4 \ge 0$) is met.
If $x_3=14$, $x_4=1$. $1 \ge 0$ (satisfied).
If $x_3=2$, $x_4=13$. $13 \ge 0$ (satisfied).
For all values of $x_3$ in $\{2, 4, \ldots, 14\}$, $x_4 = 15 - x_3$ will range from $15 - 14 = 1$ to $15 - 2 = 13$. All these values are $\ge 1$, hence $\ge 0$.
So, there are 7 distinct pairs $(x_3, x_4)$ satisfying the conditions.

The total number of distinct ways to distribute the candies is the product of the number of possibilities for $(x_1, x_2)$ and $(x_3, x_4)$.
Total ways = (Number of valid $(x_1, x_2)$ pairs) $\times$ (Number of valid $(x_3, x_4)$ pairs)
Total ways = $9 \times 7 = 63$.

The product $A(x)B(x)$ contains terms obtained by multiplying a term from $A(x)$ and a term from $B(x)$.

If $j=10$, $2i = 25 - 30 = -5$, not even.

The valid pairs $(i, j)$ are $(8, 3)$, $(5, 5)$, and $(2, 7)$.
For each valid pair $(i, j)$, the product of the corresponding terms from $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ is $x^{2i} \cdot x^{3j} = x^{2i+3j} = x^{25}$. Since all coefficients in $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are 1, the coefficient of $x^{2i+3j}$ in the product $A(x)B(x)$ is $1 \cdot 1 = 1$.
The coefficient of $x^{25}$ is the sum of the coefficients for each valid pair $(i, j)$.
The coefficient is $1$ (for $(8, 3)$) + $1$ (for $(5, 5)$) + $1$ (for $(2, 7)$) = 3.

Alternatively, solve $2i + 3j = 25$ for $i \in \{0, 1, \dots, 10\}$.
$3j = 25 - 2i$. We need $25 - 2i$ to be divisible by 3 and $0 \le (25 - 2i)/3 \le 10$.
$25 - 2i \equiv 0 \pmod 3$. Since $25 \equiv 1 \pmod 3$ and $2i \equiv -i \cdot 2 \pmod 3 \equiv -i \cdot (-1) \pmod 3 \equiv i \pmod 3$, we have $1 + i \equiv 0 \pmod 3$, so $i \equiv -1 \equiv 2 \pmod 3$.
Possible values for $i$ in the range $0 \le i \le 10$ are $2, 5, 8$.

$25 - 3j \ge 0 \implies 3j \le 25 \implies j \le 8$.
$25 - 3j$ is even implies $3j$ is odd, which means $j$ must be odd.

    "reasoning": "1.  Rewrite the term $k^2 \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{m}{k}$ using the identity $k \\binom{N}{k} = N \\binom{N-1}{k-1}$ twice. The summation runs from $k=0$, but the $k=0$ term is zero. The identity $k \\binom{n}{k} = n \\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ holds for $k \ge 1$, and $k \\binom{m}{k} = m \\binom{m-1}{k-1}$ holds for $k \ge 1$.
2.  $k^2 \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{m}{k} = (k \\binom{n}{k}) (k \\binom{m}{k}) = \\left( n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} \\right) \\left( m \\binom{m-1}{k-1} \\right)$ for $k \\ge 1$.
3.  Substitute this back into the sum $S(n,m)$. The $k=0$ term is 0, so the sum can start from $k=1$.
    $S(n,m) = \\sum_{k=1}^n nm \\binom{n-1}{k-1} \\binom{m-1}{k-1}$.
4.  Factor out the constants $nm$: $S(n,m) = nm \\sum_{k=1}^n \\binom{n-1}{k-1} \\binom{m-1}{k-1}$.
5.  Change the index of summation by setting $j=k-1$. When $k=1$, $j=0$. When $k=n$, $j=n-1$. The sum becomes:
    $S(n,m) = nm \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\binom{n-1}{j} \\binom{m-1}{j}$.
6.  Apply the identity $\\sum_{j=0}^r \\binom{A}{j} \\binom{B}{j} = \\binom{A+B}{A} = \\binom{A+B}{B}$. This identity is derived from Vandermonde's Identity by using $\\binom{B}{j} = \\binom{B}{B-j}$, giving $\\sum_{j=0}^r \\binom{A}{j} \\binom{B}{B-j} = \\binom{A+B}{B}$. The sum effectively runs up to $\min(n-1, m-1)$. With $A=n-1$ and $B=m-1$, the sum is equal to $\\binom{(n-1)+(m-1)}{n-1} = \\binom{n+m-2}{n-1}$ or $\\binom{(n-1)+(m-1)}{m-1} = \\binom{n+m-2}{m-1}$.
7.  Substitute the result of the sum back into the expression for $S(n,m)$:
    $S(n,m) = nm \\binom{n+m-2}{n-1}$.
8.  Using the symmetry property $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we can also write $\\binom{n+m-2}{n-1} = \\binom{n+m-2}{(n+m-2)-(n-1)} = \\binom{n+m-2}{m-1}$. Both forms are valid closed-form expressions. Let's choose one, e.g., $nm \\binom{n+m-2}{n-1}$. This holds for positive integers $n,m$. For $n=1$, $m \binom{m-1}{0} = m$. For $m=1$, $n \binom{n-1}{n-1} = n$. This matches the values computed directly from the sum definition for these cases."

First, find the prime factorization of $E_p^2$: $E_p^2 = (2^{p-1}M_p)^2 = 2^{2(p-1)}M_p^2$. Since 2 and $M_p$ are distinct primes, the sum of divisors function $\sigma$ is multiplicative. Thus, $\sigma(E_p^2) = \sigma(2^{2(p-1)}) \sigma(M_p^2)$.
The sum of divisors of a prime power $q^k$ is $\sigma(q^k) = \frac{q^{k+1}-1}{q-1}$.
For the factor $2^{2(p-1)}$, the sum of divisors is $\sigma(2^{2(p-1)}) = \frac{2^{2(p-1)+1}-1}{2-1} = 2^{2p-2+1}-1 = 2^{2p-1}-1$.
For the factor $M_p^2$, the sum of divisors is $\sigma(M_p^2) = \frac{M_p^{2+1}-1}{M_p-1} = \frac{M_p^3-1}{M_p-1} = M_p^2 + M_p + 1$.
So, $\sigma(E_p^2) = (2^{2p-1}-1)(M_p^2 + M_p + 1)$.
We need to find the remainder when $\sigma(E_p^2)$ is divided by $M_p$. This is $\sigma(E_p^2) \pmod{M_p}$.
$\sigma(E_p^2) \equiv (2^{2p-1}-1)(M_p^2 + M_p + 1) \pmod{M_p}$.
Since $M_p \equiv 0 \pmod{M_p}$, we have $M_p^2 + M_p + 1 \equiv 0^2 + 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{M_p}$.
So, $\sigma(E_p^2) \equiv (2^{2p-1}-1)(1) \pmod{M_p} \equiv 2^{2p-1}-1 \pmod{M_p}$.
We know that $M_p = 2^p-1$, which implies $2^p \equiv 1 \pmod{M_p}$.
Then $2^{2p-1} = 2^{2p} \cdot 2^{-1} = (2^p)^2 \cdot 2^{-1}$.
$2^{2p-1} \equiv (1)^2 \cdot 2^{-1} \pmod{M_p} \equiv 2^{-1} \pmod{M_p}$.
To find the modular inverse of 2 modulo $M_p$, we look for a number $x$ such that $2x \equiv 1 \pmod{M_p}$. Since $2^p = M_p + 1$, we have $2 \cdot 2^{p-1} = M_p + 1$.
This means $2 \cdot 2^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{M_p}$.
So, $2^{-1} \equiv 2^{p-1} \pmod{M_p}$.
Substituting this back, we get $2^{2p-1}-1 \equiv 2^{-1}-1 \pmod{M_p} \equiv 2^{p-1}-1 \pmod{M_p}$.
The remainder when $\sigma(E_p^2)$ is divided by $M_p$ is $2^{p-1}-1$. Since $p$ is prime, $p \ge 2$, so $2^{p-1}-1 < 2^p-1 = M_p$, confirming it is a valid remainder."

    "topic": "Number Theory",
    "answer": "$2^{p-1}-1$",
    "reasoning": "Let $E_p = 2^{p-1}M_p$. We are given that $p$ is a prime and $M_p = 2^p-1$ is a Mersenne prime, which means $M_p$ is also a prime number.
We need to find the sum of the divisors of $E_p^2$.
First, find the prime factorization of $E_p^2$:
$E_p^2 = (2^{p-1}M_p)^2 = (2^{p-1})^2 (M_p)^2 = 2^{2(p-1)} M_p^2 = 2^{2p-2} M_p^2$.
Since 2 and $M_p$ are distinct primes, the sum of divisors function $\sigma(n)$ can be applied directly to the prime factorization.
The formula for the sum of divisors of $n = q_1^{a_1} q_2^{a_2} \cdots q_k^{a_k}$ is $\sigma(n) = \sigma(q_1^{a_1}) \sigma(q_2^{a_2}) \cdots \sigma(q_k^{a_k})$.
Also, $\sigma(q^a) = 1 + q + \cdots + q^a = \frac{q^{a+1}-1}{q-1}$.

Applying this to $E_p^2$:
$\sigma(E_p^2) = \sigma(2^{2p-2}) \sigma(M_p^2)$.

Calculate each part:
$\sigma(2^{2p-2}) = \frac{2^{(2p-2)+1}-1}{2-1} = \frac{2^{2p-1}-1}{1} = 2^{2p-1}-1$.
$\sigma(M_p^2) = \frac{M_p^{2+1}-1}{M_p-1} = \frac{M_p^3-1}{M_p-1} = \frac{(M_p-1)(M_p^2+M_p+1)}{M_p-1} = M_p^2+M_p+1$.

So, $\sigma(E_p^2) = (2^{2p-1}-1)(M_p^2+M_p+1)$.

We need to find the remainder when $\sigma(E_p^2)$ is divided by $M_p$. This is $\sigma(E_p^2) \pmod{M_p}$.
$\sigma(E_p^2) \equiv (2^{2p-1}-1)(M_p^2+M_p+1) \pmod{M_p}$.

Consider the second factor modulo $M_p$:
$M_p^2+M_p+1 \equiv 0^2 + 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{M_p}$ since $M_p \equiv 0 \pmod{M_p}$.

So, $\sigma(E_p^2) \equiv (2^{2p-1}-1) \cdot 1 \pmod{M_p}$.
$\sigma(E_p^2) \equiv 2^{2p-1}-1 \pmod{M_p}$.

Now, we use the property $M_p = 2^p-1$, which implies $2^p \equiv 1 \pmod{M_p}$.
We want to simplify $2^{2p-1} \pmod{M_p}$.
$2^{2p-1} = 2^{2p} \cdot 2^{-1} = (2^p)^2 \cdot 2^{-1}$.
Using $2^p \equiv 1 \pmod{M_p}$, we get:
$2^{2p-1} \equiv (1)^2 \cdot 2^{-1} \equiv 2^{-1} \pmod{M_p}$.
To find $2^{-1} \pmod{M_p}$, we can use $2^p \equiv 1 \pmod{M_p}$. Multiplying by $2^{-1}$ (which exists since $M_p=2^p-1$ is odd), we get $2^{p-1} \equiv 2^{-1} \pmod{M_p}$.

Alternatively, write $2^{2p-1} = 2^p \cdot 2^{p-1}$.
$2^{2p-1} \equiv 1 \cdot 2^{p-1} \equiv 2^{p-1} \pmod{M_p}$.

Substituting this back into the expression for the remainder:
$\sigma(E_p^2) \equiv 2^{p-1}-1 \pmod{M_p}$.

The expression $2^{p-1}-1$ is the remainder if it is between $0$ and $M_p-1$.
Since $p$ is a prime, $p \ge 2$.
If $p=2$, $2^{p-1}-1 = 2^1-1 = 1$. $M_2 = 2^2-1 = 3$. $1$ is the remainder modulo 3.
If $p \ge 3$, $p-1 \ge 2$, so $2^{p-1} \ge 4$.
$2^{p-1}-1 \ge 3$.
Also, $2^{p-1}-1 < 2^p-1 = M_p$.
So, $0 \le 2^{p-1}-1 < M_p$ for any prime $p$.
Therefore, $2^{p-1}-1$ is the correct remainder.

The final answer is $2^{p-1}-1$.

        "topic": "Number Theory",
        "answer": "3",
        "reasoning": "Let $N = 1000000$. The condition $\lfloor x^2 \rfloor = N$ implies $N \le x^2 < N+1$. We are asked to find the number of possible integer values for $V = \lfloor (x+2)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor x^2 \rfloor$. Expanding the expression, we get $V = \lfloor x^2 + 4x + 4 \rfloor - \lfloor x^2 \rfloor$. Using the property $\lfloor y+k \rfloor = \lfloor y \rfloor + k$ for an integer $k$, we have $\lfloor x^2 + 4x + 4 \rfloor = \lfloor x^2 + 4x \rfloor + 4$. Thus, $V = \lfloor x^2 + 4x \rfloor + 4 - \lfloor x^2 \rfloor$. Let $f = x^2 - \lfloor x^2 \rfloor = x^2 - N$. Since $N \le x^2 < N+1$, we have $0 \le f < 1$. The expression becomes $V = \lfloor (N+f) + 4x \rfloor + 4 - N = \lfloor N + f + 4x \rfloor + 4 - N = N + \lfloor f + 4x \rfloor + 4 - N = \lfloor f + 4x \rfloor + 4$. We need to find the possible integer values of $\lfloor f + 4x \rfloor = \lfloor x^2 - N + 4x \rfloor$.

The condition $N \le x^2 < N+1$ implies $\sqrt{N} \le |x| < \sqrt{N+1}$. Since $N=1000000$, $\sqrt{N}=1000$. So $1000 \le |x| < \sqrt{1000001}$.

Case 1: $x \ge 0$.
In this case, $1000 \le x < \sqrt{1000001}$.
Multiplying by 4, we get $4000 \le 4x < 4\sqrt{1000001}$.
Let $g(x) = x^2 - N + 4x$. We need to find the range of $\lfloor g(x) \rfloor$ for $x \in [1000, \sqrt{1000001})$.
The function $g(x) = x^2 + 4x - 1000000$ is increasing for $x > -2$, so it is increasing on $[1000, \sqrt{1000001})$.
The minimum value of $g(x)$ is $g(1000) = 1000^2 - 1000000 + 4(1000) = 1000000 - 1000000 + 4000 = 4000$.
The limit as $x$ approaches $\sqrt{1000001}$ from below is $g(\sqrt{1000001}^-) = (\sqrt{1000001})^2 - 1000000 + 4\sqrt{1000001} = 1000001 - 1000000 + 4\sqrt{1000001} = 1 + 4\sqrt{1000001}$.
Let's estimate $4\sqrt{1000001} = \sqrt{16 \times 1000001} = \sqrt{16000016}$.
$4000^2 = 16000000$, $4001^2 = 16008001$, $4002^2 = 16016004$.
So $4000 < \sqrt{16000016} < 4001$ is incorrect. $4000^2=16000000$, $4001^2 = 16008001$, $4002^2=16016004$, $4003^2 = 16024009$.
$\sqrt{16000016}$ is between $4000$ and $4001$.
$4000^2 = 16000000$. $4000.001^2 = (4000+0.001)^2 = 16000000 + 8 + 0.000001 = 16000008.000001$.
$4000.002^2 = (4000+0.002)^2 = 16000000 + 16 + 0.000004 = 16000016.000004$.
So $\sqrt{16000016} \approx 4000.001999...$
$4\sqrt{1000001} \approx 4000.001999...$
The range of $g(x)$ for $x \ge 0$ is $[4000, 1 + 4\sqrt{1000001}) = [4000, 1 + 4000.001999...) = [4000, 4001.001999...)$.
The possible integer values for $\lfloor g(x) \rfloor$ are $\lfloor 4000 \rfloor = 4000$ and $\lfloor 4001.something \rfloor = 4001$. Both values are achievable because the interval $[4000, 4001.001999...)$ contains numbers in $[4000, 4001)$ and numbers in $[4001, 4001.001999...)$.

Case 2: $x < 0$.
In this case, $-\sqrt{1000001} < x \le -1000$.
Multiplying by 4, we get $-4\sqrt{1000001} < 4x \le -4000$.
$-4000.001999... < 4x \le -4000$.
Let $h(x) = x^2 - N + 4x$. We need the range of $\lfloor h(x) \rfloor$ for $x \in (-\sqrt{1000001}, -1000]$.
The function $h(x) = x^2 + 4x - 1000000$ is decreasing for $x < -2$, so it is decreasing on $(-\sqrt{1000001}, -1000]$.
The maximum value of $h(x)$ is $h(-1000) = (-1000)^2 - 1000000 + 4(-1000) = 1000000 - 1000000 - 4000 = -4000$.
The limit as $x$ approaches $-\sqrt{1000001}$ from above is $h(-\sqrt{1000001}^+) = (\sqrt{1000001})^2 - 1000000 + 4(-\sqrt{1000001}) = 1000001 - 1000000 - 4\sqrt{1000001} = 1 - 4\sqrt{1000001}$.
$1 - 4\sqrt{1000001} \approx 1 - 4000.001999... = -3999.001999...$
The range of $h(x)$ for $x < 0$ is $(1 - 4\sqrt{1000001}, -4000] = (-3999.001999..., -4000]$.
The only integer in this interval is $-4000$. So the only possible value for $\lfloor h(x) \rfloor$ is $-4000$.

Combining both cases, the possible integer values for $\lfloor x^2 - 1000000 + 4x \rfloor$ are $\{4000, 4001\}$ from Case 1 and $\{-4000\}$ from Case 2.
The set of possible integer values for $\lfloor x^2 - 1000000 + 4x \rfloor$ is $\{-4000, 4000, 4001\}$.

The possible integer values for $\lfloor (x+2)^2 \rfloor - \lfloor x^2 \rfloor = 4 + \lfloor x^2 - 1000000 + 4x \rfloor$ are:
$4 + (-4000) = -3996$
$4 + 4000 = 4004$
$4 + 4001 = 4005$

These three values $-3996, 4004, 4005$ are distinct integer values. All three values are achievable as shown in the analysis of the ranges of $\lfloor g(x) \rfloor$ and $\lfloor h(x) \rfloor$.

The number of possible integer values is 3.

The final answer is $\boxed{3}$."

        "topic": "Number Theory",
        "answer": "2",
        "reasoning": "Let the prime factorization of $x$ be $\prod p_i^{\alpha_i}$ and $y$ be $\prod p_i^{\beta_i}$.\nFor $x^y = \prod p_i^{\alpha_i y}$ to be a perfect square, $\alpha_i y$ must be even for all $i$. This means for every $p_i$ with $\alpha_i > 0$, either $\alpha_i$ is even or $y$ is even. Equivalently, $v_{p_i}(x)$ must be a multiple of $2/\gcd(y, 2)$ for all $i$.\nFor $y^x = \prod p_i^{\beta_i x}$ to be a perfect cube, $\beta_i x$ must be a multiple of 3 for all $i$. This means for every $p_i$ with $\beta_i > 0$, either $\beta_i$ is a multiple of 3 or $x$ is a multiple of 3. Equivalently, $v_{p_i}(y)$ must be a multiple of $3/\gcd(x, 3)$ for all $i$.

Let $g_2 = \gcd(y, 2)$ and $g_3 = \gcd(x, 3)$. The conditions are that $v_p(x)$ is a multiple of $2/g_2$ for all primes $p$, and $v_p(y)$ is a multiple of $3/g_3$ for all primes $p$. We consider the four cases for the possible values of $(g_2, g_3)$:

Case 1: $g_2=1$ ($y$ is odd) and $g_3=1$ ($x$ is not a multiple of 3).
$v_p(x)$ must be a multiple of $2/1=2$ for all $p$, so $x$ is a perfect square ($x=k^2$).
$v_p(y)$ must be a multiple of $3/1=3$ for all $p$, so $y$ is a perfect cube ($y=m^3$).
$y=m^3$ is odd $\implies m$ is odd.
$x=k^2$ is not a multiple of 3 $\implies k$ is not a multiple of 3.
We seek to minimize $x+y = k^2 + m^3$ with $k \not\equiv 0 \pmod 3$ and $m$ odd. The smallest possible values for $k$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, \ldots$ and for $m$ are $1, 3, 5, \ldots$.
Trying small values: $(k, m) = (1, 1) \implies (x, y) = (1^2, 1^3) = (1, 1)$. $x+y = 1+1=2$. $(1,1)$ satisfies the case conditions ($1$ is odd, $1$ is not a multiple of 3). $1^1=1$ is a square, $1^1=1$ is a cube. Valid.
$(k, m) = (2, 1) \implies (x, y) = (2^2, 1^3) = (4, 1)$. $x+y = 4+1=5$. Valid.
$(k, m) = (1, 3) \implies (x, y) = (1^2, 3^3) = (1, 27)$. $x+y = 1+27=28$. Valid.
The minimum in this case is 2.

Case 2: $g_2=1$ ($y$ is odd) and $g_3=3$ ($x$ is a multiple of 3).
$v_p(x)$ must be a multiple of $2/1=2$ for all $p$, so $x$ is a perfect square ($x=k^2$).
$v_p(y)$ must be a multiple of $3/3=1$ for all $p$, so $y$ is any integer.
$y$ is odd.
$x=k^2$ is a multiple of 3 $\implies k$ is a multiple of 3.
We seek to minimize $x+y = k^2 + y$ with $k \equiv 0 \pmod 3$ and $y$ odd.
Smallest $k$ is 3, so smallest $x=3^2=9$. Smallest odd $y$ is 1.
$(x, y) = (9, 1)$. $x+y=9+1=10$. $(9,1)$ satisfies the case conditions ($1$ is odd, $9$ is a multiple of 3). $9^1=9$ is a square, $1^9=1$ is a cube. Valid.

Case 3: $g_2=2$ ($y$ is even) and $g_3=1$ ($x$ is not a multiple of 3).
$v_p(x)$ must be a multiple of $2/2=1$ for all $p$, so $x$ is any integer.
$v_p(y)$ must be a multiple of $3/1=3$ for all $p$, so $y$ is a perfect cube ($y=m^3$).
$y=m^3$ is even $\implies m$ is even.
$x$ is not a multiple of 3.
We seek to minimize $x+y = x + m^3$ with $x \not\equiv 0 \pmod 3$ and $m$ even.
Smallest $m$ is 2, so smallest $y=2^3=8$. Smallest $x$ not a multiple of 3 is 1.
$(x, y) = (1, 8)$. $x+y=1+8=9$. $(1,8)$ satisfies the case conditions ($8$ is even, $1$ is not a multiple of 3). $1^8=1$ is a square, $8^1=8$ is a cube. Valid.

Case 4: $g_2=2$ ($y$ is even) and $g_3=3$ ($x$ is a multiple of 3).
$v_p(x)$ must be a multiple of $2/2=1$ for all $p$, so $x$ is any integer.
$v_p(y)$ must be a multiple of $3/3=1$ for all $p$, so $y$ is any integer.
$x$ is a multiple of 3.
$y$ is even.
We seek to minimize $x+y$ with $x \equiv 0 \pmod 3$ and $y$ is even.
Smallest $x$ is 3. Smallest $y$ is 2.
$(x, y) = (3, 2)$. $x+y=3+2=5$. $(3,2)$ satisfies the case conditions ($2$ is even, $3$ is a multiple of 3). $3^2=9$ is a square, $2^3=8$ is a cube. Valid.

Comparing the minimum values found in each case: 2, 10, 9, 5. The overall minimum possible value of $x+y$ is 2.

The minimum value of $x+y$ occurs in Case 1 with $(x,y)=(1,1)$, giving $x+y=2$.

Final check: $x=1, y=1$. $x^y = 1^1 = 1$, which is a perfect square ($1^2$). $y^x = 1^1 = 1$, which is a perfect cube ($1^3$). Both conditions are satisfied for positive integers $x=1, y=1$. $x+y = 1+1=2$.
